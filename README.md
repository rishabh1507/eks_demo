# DevOps Assignment- EKS

As part of this assignment, we would like to evaluate candidateâ€™s skills and knowledge related to AWS. Candidate is supposed to complete the following assignment to the best of their abilities.

Please perform the below projects on a free AWS account(create a new one if required).

## Assignment scenario:

Design a highly available and scalable containerised application on Amazon EKS. Below are the requirements and deliverables:

## Requirements:

1. Create an EKS cluster along with a node-group with t3.small instances using [eksctl](https://eksctl.io/)(using config files).
2. Deploy a simple [Hello World container](https://hub.docker.com/r/amazon/amazon-ecs-sample) on EKS this cluster.
3. Expose this application on internet using Application Load balancer.
4. Configure this application to autoscale based on CPU utilisation(70% CPU)

**Note-** Please use manifest files to create all the resources and avoid using UI. 

## Deliverables:

1. Complete setup by showcasing the application accessible from internet.- Done
2. Link of a Github repo hosting the config files used to create the above setup. - Done
3. Provide suggestions on how you would make this application more secure and cost-effective. -
Rightnow the ekscluster uses 2 public and private subnet each. I will try to slim down the setup by only keeping 2 private subnets, nat gateway and will attach an ALB to access the application this will make the setup secure and cost effective. 
Example sample
```
apiVersion: eksctl.io/v1alpha5
kind: ClusterConfig

metadata:
  name: prodigal-vpc
  region: ap-northeast-1

vpc:
  id: "vpc-0f3622456d4d54898"
  cidr: 172.31.0.0/16
  subnets:
    private:
      ap-northeast-1a:
        cidr: 192.168.1.0/24
  
      ap-northeast-1c:
        cidr: 192.168.2.0/24
  nat:
    gateway: HighlyAvailable 

NodeGroups:
- name: prodigal-node1
  instanceType: t3.small
  minSize: 1
  maxSize: 5  
  desiredCapacity: 1
  privateNetworking: true
  availabilityZones: ["ap-northeast-1a"] 

- name: prodigal-node2
  instanceType: t3.small
  minSize: 1
  maxSize: 5  
  desiredCapacity: 1
  privateNetworking: true
  availabilityZones: ["ap-northeast-1c"]

```

Good luck! We look forward to seeing your work.
